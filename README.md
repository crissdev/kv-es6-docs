# kv-es6-docs

A simple app created with ES6 and Knockout to browse through Knockout-Validation documentation.

**This is work in progress and any help is welcome. Hopefully this repo will become the `gh-pages` branch
of [Knockout-Validation](https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/Knockout-Validation/) library.**


### Run the app

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crissdev/kv-es6-docs.git
npm install
npm start
```
